How a history finder for dates works

1.User Input

The user types in a date (e.g., 15 August 1947).

The input can be just a day-month (to show recurring events like holidays) or a full date (to show events tied to a specific year).

2.Data Source

The app needs a database of historical events.

This could be:

A local JSON/CSV file (for smaller projects).

An API like Wikipedia, History API, or any “On This Day” dataset.

A custom database you build with events.

3.Matching Logic

The app compares the input date with the stored events.

For example:

Input: 15-08-1947

Database lookup → returns “India’s Independence Day.”

4.Output Display

The result is shown to the user, usually in a neat format:

Title of the event

Description

Images, links, or references (optional).

Extra Features (optional)

Search by keywords: “Show me all events about World War II.”

Filter by category: politics, sports, science, culture.

Timeline view: Display events across years.
